# CivivLens
CivicLens uses generative AI and public data APIs to make government transparency, community impact, and public project spending more accessible to citizens. It automatically aggregates open government datasets, budget reports, and procurement documents â€” then uses Geminito translate them into plain language insights, dashboards, and alerts.
